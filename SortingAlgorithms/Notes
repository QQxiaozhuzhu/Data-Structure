Stability in Sorting Algorithms:
    Stable sorting algorithm preserve the relative order of equal elements, while unstable sorting algorithm dont.
    in other words, stable sorting maintains the position of two equal elements relative to one another

    Example:
            Unsorted List: 2 4 1 7 4 9

            Stable Sort: 1 2 4 4 7 9
                             A B
                   Because the order of equal elements is maintained in the sorted list.
            Unstable Sort: 1 2 4 4 7 9
                               B A
                   Because the order of equal elements is not maintained in the sorted list.
